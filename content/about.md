    <h4 id="main-description">Hi, Iâ€™m <a href="/img/xianda.png">Xianda</a>. </h4>
    <p>I'm from China. Currently, I'm pursuing my master's degree of Environmental Sciences at ETH Zurich, majoring in ecology and evolution (<a href="/pdf/CV_XiandaGuo_2018_09.pdf">my CV</a>). I'm very glad to study in Switzerland and at ETH. Our department is very open and cross-disciplinary encouraging us to explore the boundary of knowledge.</p>    

    <p>My initial motivation to do data visualisation is to explore some of my concerns from a data perspective. I began to learn <a href="/project/">data visualisation</a> since the beginning of 2018 from <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org">R</a>, <a href="https://d3js.org">d3.js</a> to <a href="https://processing.org">processing</a> and <a href="https://p5js.org">p5.js</a> in my free time. I enjoyed the process and hope to enrich my knowledge and skills to the level of effective and impressive communication.</p>

    <p>I hope to devote myself to raise people's environmental awareness and independent thinking in my following career, simply because it is far away from perfection. I think data visualisation and interaction design will be a handy tool.</p>

    <p>Art is the other sides of my life beside science. I learned <a href="/img/art_exercises.jpg">drawing and painting</a> during my childhood and decided to study science in the university. However, as Flaubert once said, art and science will meet at the peak. I have begun to do something about <a href="/project/artscience/darkmatter/">artscience</a>. Also, I write blogs for <a href="https://as-org.com">the Art & Science Research Center</a> to introduce artists and concepts in the field of artscience.</p>

    <p>I am sometimes flooded in thinking, which is good as well as dangerous. Therefore, I feel obliged to train myself with logic, which is my important hobby. Well, it's not an easy activity, but I feel peaceful and happy when acting.</p>

    <p>I am a person full of self-motivation and I learn fast. For example, to prepare my portfolio, I leant and built this website over one weekend with <a target="_blank" href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. I feel I have lots of potentials and I want to be free.</p>
