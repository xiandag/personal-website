<p><strong> What should the invisible look like?</strong></p>

<p>Dark matter is one invisible composition of the known universe, accounting for 25% of the total content (with about 4% in luminous stars and gas and 70% as dark energy). Astronomers cannot detect it directly because much of it does not emit electromagnetic radiation. However, it is known that dark matter does exist, and there is a lot of it, because the gravity of the visible material is not strong enough to form galaxies and complex structures. The interaction between dark matter and gravity helps to prevent galaxies flying apart. </p>

<p>In the autumn of 2017, I was taking a course called The Art of Scientific Visualization course at University of Zurich by <a href=http://www2.physics.umanitoba.ca/u/english/>Prof. Jayanne English</a>, who does researches in astronomy, also keeping an eye on arts and public outreach. During the semester, we learned design principles, like colour theories, composition as well as interaction. We were also assigned with a public outreach project with five black-and-white slices of <a href=https://www.media.uzh.ch/en/Press-Releases/2017/Virtual-Kosmos.html> the computer simulated dark matter universe</a> by the Joachim Stadel group at UZH.</p>

<p> I planned to represent <strong> a dynamic universe</strong>, so I used "contrast of hue" applying five easily distinguishable colours. The canvas was set vertically. Moreover, people's eyes were led to get into the picture from the lower left corner, along the cyan track to the upper left corner, and then they would fall naturally, meeting a cross of green and yellow, which was the secondary point I wanted to emphasise to show that the depth of space did exist. The result turned to be well vivid. To my surprise, except for the five initial colours, other colours, like orange, also appeared on the picture. It is due to the effect of addition, which could be used to show the overlapping of dark matter in the depth.</p>
