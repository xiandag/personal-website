<p>One day, I was watching a documentary by BBC TWO called <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01k0fs0">The Men Who Made Us Fat</a>. I was so shocked how strongly the industry and economy have shaped our figures since the end of the 1970s, such as habit of snack, super-sized portion, and combo meals. Even for healthy food, like cereal, smoothie and orange juice, some kinds have more calories, and we are more likely to consume more because of its healthy implication. Most of the time, we aren't even aware of the fact.</p>

<p>In fact, the obesity has constantly increased, becoming a global issue threatening human health. I got some statistical data from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/obesity">Our World in Data</a> (data source: <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-I7695e.pdf">The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2017</a> published by FAO).Intuitively, I think fat cells will be very impressive to show the truth, so I used processing to make a scene of increasing fat cells (adopted from a script by <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/27252">Asher Salmon</a>, combined with some sound to show the annual increase.</p>
