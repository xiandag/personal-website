<p><strong>When data is overwhelming, a smart visualisation will be handy.</strong></p>

<p>For my master thesis, we got massive real-time data from soil at 10-min resolution. We are cheerful for the comprehensive record of the soil environment, but it is also challenging to figure out temporary patterns on diverse scales and crucial events. </p>

<p>In the beginning of the project, I chose to use spiral graphs to represent the data, which turned out to be effective to have a view on the happenings directly. The spiral is clock-like with each circle representing the data of one day, and outward circles are later than the inward. From the spiral, we could recognise daily changes and seasonal consistence. Next, we will try to identify some influential events according to the graph and apply statistical analysis.</p>
